# 🩸 Roman // 0xD0R0  

Offensive Security Engineer · Red Team Operator · Code & Coffee Junkie  

I break things so you can build them safer.  
From stealth-mode recon to post-exfil clean-up, I live in the gap between “impossible” and “already pwned”.

## 🔥 Mission Brief

• Spear-heading full-scope pentests (web, infra, cloud)  
• Crafting zero-noise Python & PHP tooling for ops automation  
• Talking TCP/IP fluently—pivoting, packet-crafting, and dropping shells since dial-up  
• Mapping threat surfaces, slipping past blue teams, and reporting with surgical detail  
• Preaching purple-team culture: teach defenders by playing the villain
