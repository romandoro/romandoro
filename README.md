# 🩸 Roman // 0xD0R0  

Offensive Security Specialist · Pentester · Code & Coffee Junkie  

I break things so others can build them safer.  
From silent recon to post-exfil cleanup, I operate in the twilight zone between “impossible” and “already pwned”.

## 🔥 Mission Brief

• Conduct full-scope penetration tests (web, infra, cloud)  
• Craft zero-noise Python & PHP tooling for ops automation  
• Speak native TCP/IP—pivoting, packet-crafting, and dropping shells since dial-up  
• Map threat surfaces, slip past blue teams, and report with surgical detail  
• Advocate purple-team culture: teach defenders by playing the villain
